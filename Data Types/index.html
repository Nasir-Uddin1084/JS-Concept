		<h3>Data Types</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Number data type</li>
			<p>
				JavaScript has only one type of numbers. <br />

				Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
			</p>
			<li>String data type</li>
			<p>
				A string (or a text string) is a series of character. <br />

				Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes.
			</p>
			<li>Object data type</li>
			<p>
				JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}. <br />

				Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
			</p>
			<li>Array data type</li>
			<p>
				JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. <br />

				Array items are separated by commas. <br />
				Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second
				is [1], and so on.
			</p>
			<li>Boolean data type</li>
			<p>
				Booleans can only have two values: true or false. <br />
				Booleans are often used in conditional testing.
			</p>
			<li>Null data type</li>
			<p>
				The null type is the second primitive data type that also has only one
				value: null. <br />

				Javascript defines that null is an empty object pointer.
			</p>
			<li>Undefined data type</li>
			<p>
				In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The
				type is also undefined. <br />
				Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type
				will also be undefined.
			</p>
			<li>NaN data type</li>
			<p>
				JavaScript has a special numeric value called NaN, which stands for Not
				a Number. <br />
				In fact, it means an invalid number.
			</p>
			<li>The symbol data type</li>
			<p>
				JavaScript added a primitive type in ES6: the symbol. Different from
				other primitive types, <br />
				the symbol type does not have a literal form. <br />
				<br />
				Note that Symbol is a function, not an object constructor, therefore,
				you cannot use the new operator. <br />
				If you do so, you will get a TypeError.
