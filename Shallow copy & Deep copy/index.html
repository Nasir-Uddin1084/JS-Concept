		<h1>Shallow Copy & Deep Copy</h1>
		<p>There are 2 types of array cloning: shallow & deep.</p>
		<h3>Shallow Copy</h3>
		<p>
			Shallow copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. A new object is created that
			has an exact copy of the values in the original object. <br />
			just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is
			copied.it will affect the origin one
		</p>
		<h3>Deep Copy</h3>
		<p>
			A deep copy means actually creating a new array and copying over the
			values, since whatever happens to it will never affect the origin one.
