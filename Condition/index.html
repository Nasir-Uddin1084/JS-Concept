  <h1>Condition</h1>
  <h2> JavaScript includes following forms of if-else conditions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>if condition</li>
    <li>if-else condition</li>
    <li>else if condition</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>if condition</h3>
  <p>
    Use if conditional statement if you want to execute something based on some condition.
  </p>
  <p>
    if (condition) { <br>
    statement1 <br>
    } else { <br>
    statement2 <br>
    } <br>
  <p>
  <h3>else condition</h3>
  <p>
    Use else statement when you want to execute the code every time when if condition evaluates to false.
  </p>
  <h4>condition</h4>
  An expression that is considered to be either truth or false.
  </p>
  <p>
  <h4>statement1</h4>
  Statement that is executed if condition is truthy. Can be any statement, including further nested if statements. <br>
  To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements. To execute no statements,
  <br> use an empty statement.
  </p>
  <p>
  <h4>statement2</h4>
  Statement that is executed if condition is falsy and the else clause exists. Can be any statement, including block
  statements and further nested if statements.
  </p>
  </p>
  <h3>else if condition</h3>
  <p>
    Use "else if" condition when you want to apply second level condition after if statement.
  </p>
  <p>
  <h5>
    Syntax:
  </h5>
  if(condition expression) <br>
  {<br>
  //Execute this code block <br>
  } <br>
  else if(condition expression){ <br>
  //Execute this code block <br>
  }
  </p>
  <h4>
    Points to Remember :
  </h4>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use if-else conditional statements to control the program flow.
    </li>
    <li>
      JavaScript includes three forms of if condition: if condition, if else condition and else if condition.

    </li>
    <li>
      The if condition must have conditional expression in brackets () followed by single statement or code block
      wrapped with { }.

    </li>
    <li>
      'else if' statement must be placed after if condition. It can be used multiple times.

    </li>
    <li>
      'else' condition must be placed only once at the end. It must come after if or else if statement.

    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>
    switch condition
  </h3>
  <p>
    The switch is a conditional statement like if statement. Switch is useful when you want to execute one of the
    multiple <br> code blocks based on the return value of a specified expression.
  </p>
  <p>
  <h5>
    Syntax:
  </h5>
  switch(expression or literal value){ <br>
  case 1: <br>
  //code to be executed <br>
  break; <br>
  case 2: <br>
  //code to be executed <br>
  break; <br>
  case n: <br>
  //code to be executed <br>
  break; <br>
  default: <br>
  //default code to be executed <br>
  //if none of the above case executed <br>
  } <br>
  </p>
  <p>As per the above syntax, switch statement contains an expression or literal value. An expression will return a
    value when evaluated. <br> The switch can includes multiple cases where each case represents a particular value.
    Code under particular case will be executed <br> when case value is equal to the return value of switch expression.
    If none of the cases match with switch expression value then the <br> default case will be executed.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Points to Remember :
  </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The switch is a conditional statement like if statement.
    </li>
    <li>
      A switch statement includes literal value or is expression based
    </li>
    <li>
      A switch statement includes multiple cases that include code blocks to execute.
    </li>
    <li>
      A break keyword is used to stop the execution of case block.
    </li>
    <li>
      A switch case can be combined to execute same code block for multiple cases.
    </li>
  </ul>
